# EMOCIONA APP

**Emociona** is a mobile application designed to help users **manage their emotions** by recording **daily feelings**, understanding their **causes**, and accessing effective 
**self-regulation techniques**. Developed in **Android Studio**, this app combines emotional self-awareness with engaging **gamification** elements 
to promote consistent use.

## FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

## Emotion register

Users can record their **emotions** daily, noting the **causes** behind them. This helps track emotional patterns and fosters self-awareness. Based on the logged emotion, the app suggests an **activity for the day** to improve emotional regulation.

## Downloadable reports

Users can download their emotion logs as **PDF files**, enabling them to share insights with mental health professionals. This feature aids therapists by offering a detailed and 
objective record of the user's emotional state over time.

## Self-regulation techniques

The app provides scientifically-backed self-regulation activities, including:

- **Breathing exercises**.
- **Progressive muscle relaxation**.
- **Body scan**.
- **Mindfulness meditation**.
- **Daily mindfulness practices**.

These techniques are tailored to help users reduce stress and enhance well-being.

## Gamification

To motivate users and encourage consistent interaction, the app integrates various gamification elements, providing an enjoyable and engaging experience:

- **Badges**: Users can earn unique badges for completing their emotion logs every day of the month. A new badge is available each month, rewarding commitment and encouraging continuity.

- **Mini-game "El jardín encantado"** (*The enchanted garden*): In this mini-game, users grow a plant by logging their emotions daily. Consistent logs ensure the plant thrives, while missed days cause it to wither. Users can recover up to three missed days by using water cans. If three days are missed without recovery, the plant dies and cannot be revived. At the start of each month, a new plant will sprout, themed around the current season.

- **Mini-game "El laberinto"** (*The maze*): A game designed to enhance focus and relaxation. Users navigate through a maze while avoiding distractions, promoting mindfulness.

- **Mini-game "Puzzle"**: This game provides soothing imagery for users to assemble, fostering concentration and providing a break from stress.
 
- **Mini-game "Cartas idénticas"** (*Identical Cards*): A memory-matching game that encourages cognitive engagement while promoting calmness.
